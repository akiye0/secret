        <h1>CONGRATS! YOU HAVE REACHED THE END ü¶´</h1>

        <h2>You have finished going through my silly maze :)</h2>

        <h3>I really enjoyed the Cyber Operations class! I initially had absolutely zero knowledge of cyber security (or frankly, anything taught in this course really)</h3>
        <h3>The first two weeks of the activities were honestly rough, I had no idea what I was doing as well as where to even start</h3>
        <h3>+ I also just become super nervous when I talk and struggle with speaking probably more than average so that was also a bit of a challenge for me</h3>
        <h3>Even so, your lessons were always fun, with a bunch of stories and technologies I previously never knew about! Additionally, the lessons the TAs had for us were interactive & educational with real life examples we can relate to.</h3>
        <h3>Throughout the course, I slowly got over my struggles too. Capstone week was so fun for me! I generally understood, even if it was vague, what we were doing and I felt super accomplished by the end ‚ò∫Ô∏è</h3>
        <h3>I know I was pretty quiet (and I am very sorry I wasn't able to be a great teammate most of the time) but by the end I felt comfortable with my team and was able to collaborate.</h3>
        <h3>BWSI helped me remember how fun learning was, especially with how rough high school was last year haha</h3>
        <h3>I also gained back a good chunk of my confidence by getting better at communicating! I will keep working at improving that one</h3>
        <h3>So I want to say thank you. Thank you for teaching us so well in a fun manner for a straight month. This was an incredible class with a whole bunch of experiences (the kimchi & the ranch, the putt party, "let's talk about javascript"...)</h3>
        <h3>Thank you to Agent Slogni... or Ingols? and all of the TAS!!! & Have a great rest of your summer ‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <h1>THANK YOU CYBER OPERATIONS BWSI 2025</h1>

        <h4>p.s. agent slogni, your jokes were pretty funny</h4>

        <h5>p.p.s. here's the original jpg file of you I drew (I swear it's not an evil link)</h5>
